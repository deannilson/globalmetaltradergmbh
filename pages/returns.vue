      <h4>Returns</h4>
      We have a 14-day return policy, which means you have 14 days after
      receiving your stock to request a return. To be eligible for a return,
      your stock must be in the same condition that you received them. You’ll
      also need the receipt or proof of purchase. <br />
      <br />
      To start a return, you can contact us on our email. Please note that
      returns will need to be sent to the following address:
      <b> {{ $app.address }}</b
      >. <br />
      If your return is accepted, we’ll send you our couriers, as well as
      instructions on how and where to send the stock back to us without first
      requesting a return will not be accepted. <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Damages and issues</h4>
      Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the
      stock is complete, or if you received the wrong stock, so that we can
      evaluate the issue and make it right. <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Refunds</h4>
      We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let
      you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
      automatically refunded on your original payment method within 7 business
      days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank to process and
      post the refund too.
